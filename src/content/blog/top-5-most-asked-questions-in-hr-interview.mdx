Our most important tip for preparing for HR interviews is that you prepare your answer before hand and rehearse it.

The most common thought among fresh graduates is the ‘I know myself well’ attitude. Sure, we all know ourselves well, but, we should be able to articulate that to an interview with the right words, conviction and poise. And, that’s the communication and personality test that you are unaware of.

Next time you appear for job interviews at the company, spend some time working on the above questions.
