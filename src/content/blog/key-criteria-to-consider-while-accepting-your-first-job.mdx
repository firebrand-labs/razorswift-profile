mainDescription: Here are some key criteria to consider while accepting your first job
---

- Create a 5-year plan.
- Consider the longer-term trajectory starting with your first job.
- Create a list of the pros and cons of taking this particular job as your first job.
- Remember that it is your life…and your decision.
- Ask the right questions before you take any job.

#### When accepting your first job, it is important to consider several factors. Here are some key criteria to consider:

- Salary or hourly wage: Assess the income your potential employer offers and compare it to your financial needs.
- Benefits package: Supplemental benefits packages may provide substantial value. Benefits can include financial incentives, such as stock options and retirement plans, as well as indirect financial benefits, such as health insurance.
- Working hours: The hours you’re required to work each week are another item to assess when evaluating a job offer. Both longer and shorter hours can be beneficial in the right circumstances.
- Responsibilities: Check the responsibilities that come with the job offer.
- Company culture: Consider the company culture and whether it aligns with your values.
- Career growth opportunities: Consider whether there are opportunities for career growth within the company.
- Commute time: Consider how long it will take you to get to work.

#### Here are some common mistakes to avoid while accepting your first job

- Relying on yourself for guidance: Don’t be afraid to raise your hand and ask for help from your managers and peers when you need it.
- Underestimating the importance of grunt work: Grunt work is an incredible opportunity to dive deeper into learning about your company while proving to your manager that you’re reliable and trustworthy.
- Expecting praise and promotions to come easily: Much of what you’ll do in your first job (or any job) is about being patient and proving yourself.
