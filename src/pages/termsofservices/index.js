            Login at Your end. You should, therefore, not share Your User Login

            responsible for all activities that occur under Your Account.
            RazorSwift will not be liable for any damage or loss that may result
            from Your failure to protect Your login information, including Your
            password. Without limiting the foregoing, You are solely responsible

            Service Data is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.
            You also maintain all responsibility for determining whether the
